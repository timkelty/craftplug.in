 * 
 * When things get real (or at least really complex), then it's time to start using
 * the Service file. Some good reasons to use a Service method:
 *
 *     1. Your logic is super complex.
 *     2. You need to interact with the database.
 *     3. You want to call your service from some other plugin.
 * 
 * If you find yourself needing to tap into the database for whatever reason, that logic
 * belongs here. Whether you're approaching the database with a custom Record (not included),
 * or you need to write a custom query to do the job, this is the place to make it happen.
 *
 * Your service methods can literally be anything you want them to be. Go nuts!
